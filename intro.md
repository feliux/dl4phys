# Deep Learning for Particle Physicists

> Welcome to the graduate course on deep learning at the [Albert Einstein Center for Fundamental Physics](https://www.einstein.unibe.ch/) of the University of Bern!

## Why all the fuss?

Deep learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make predictions about something in the world. In the last decade, this framework has led to significant advances in [computer vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA&feature=youtu.be), [natural language processing](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/), and [reinforcement learning](https://openai.com/blog/emergent-tool-use/). More recently, machine learning has begun to attract interest in the physical sciences and is rapidly becoming an important part of the physicist's toolkit, especially in data-rich fields like high-energy particle physics and cosmology.
